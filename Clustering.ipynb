        "\n",
        "**1. Varying Cluster Sizes:**\n",
        "* Problem: K-Means may not perform well when the clusters have significantly different sizes. K-Means tends to create clusters of similar sizes because it aims to minimize the variance within each cluster.\n",
        "* Why: K-Means uses centroids to represent clusters. The algorithm assigns points to the nearest centroid based on Euclidean distance, which is sensitive to the overall spread of data. If a large cluster and a small cluster exist, K-Means may end up splitting the large cluster into several smaller ones or combining parts of different clusters.\n",
        "* Example: Imagine two clusters — one is large and spherical, the other is small and elongated. K-Means will likely divide the larger cluster into multiple smaller ones to minimize variance, but it may miss the true structure of the smaller, elongated cluster.\n",

        "**2. Varying Cluster Densities:**\n",
        "* Problem: K-Means performs poorly when the clusters have different densities. The algorithm assumes that points in a cluster are close to the centroid, which may not hold when clusters have differing densities.\n",
        "* Why: K-Means will try to minimize the distance between points and centroids, and in cases of uneven densities, the algorithm might misassign points to the wrong clusters. For example, points from a dense cluster might get assigned to a nearby less dense cluster simply because it has a closer centroid.\n",
